      <p>
        On 9 February 1953, then a Bedlington Grammar School pupil, Charlton was
        spotted playing for East Northumberland schools by Manchester United
        chief scout Joe Armstrong.[16] Charlton went on to play for England
        Schoolboys and the 15-year-old signed amateur forms with United on 1
        January 1953 along with Wilf McGuinness, also aged 15.[17] Initially his
        mother was reluctant to let him commit to an insecure football career,
        so he began an apprenticeship as an electrical engineer; however, he
        went on to turn professional in October 1954.[18]
        <br />Charlton became one of the famed Busby Babes, the collection of
        talented footballers who emerged through the system at Old Trafford in
        the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s as Matt Busby set about a long-term plan of
        rebuilding the club after the Second World War.[19] He worked his way
        through the pecking order of teams, scoring regularly for the youth and
        reserve sides before he was handed his first team debut against Charlton
        Athletic in October 1956 where he scored two goals in a game that
        finished 4–2.[20] At the same time, he was doing his National service
        with the Royal Army Ordnance Corps in Shrewsbury, where Busby had
        advised him to apply as it meant he could still play for Manchester
        United at the weekend. Also doing his army service in Shrewsbury at the
        same time was his United teammate Duncan Edwards.[19] Charlton played 17
        times for United in that first season, scoring twice on his debut and
        managing a total of 12 goals in all competitions,[21] and including a
        hat-trick in a 5–1 away win over Charlton Athletic in February.[22]
        United won the league championship but were denied the 20th century's
        first "double" when they controversially lost the 1957 FA Cup Final to
        Aston Villa.[23] Charlton, still only 19, was selected for the game,
        which saw United goalkeeper Ray Wood carried off with a broken cheekbone
        after a clash with Villa centre forward Peter McParland.[24] Charlton
        was a candidate to go in goal to replace Wood (in the days before
        substitutes, and certainly before goalkeeping substitutes), but it was
        teammate Jackie Blanchflower who ended up playing in goal.[citation
        needed] <br />
        Charlton was an established player by the time the next season was fully
        underway, which saw United, as current League champions, become the
        first English team to compete in the European Cup. Previously, the
        Football Association had scorned the competition, but United made
        progress, reaching the semi-finals where they lost to holders Real
        Madrid. Their reputation was further enhanced the next season in the
        1957–58 European Cup as they reached the quarter-finals to play Red Star
        Belgrade. In the first leg at home, United won 2–1. The return in
        Yugoslavia saw Charlton score twice as United stormed 3–0 ahead,
        although the hosts came back to earn a 3–3 draw. However, United
        maintained their aggregate lead to reach the last four and were in
        jubilant mood as they left to catch their flight home, thinking of an
        important League game against Wolves at the weekend.[citation needed]
        Munich air disaster <br />
        Charlton died at Macclesfield District General Hospital in Macclesfield,
        Cheshire, on 21 October 2023, at the age of 86, from complications of a
        fall he sustained at the nursing home where he resided; at the
        subsequent inquest, the coroner recorded his cause of death as "trauma
        in the lungs, a fall and dementia."[59][60] His death leaves Sir Geoff
        Hurst as the last surviving English player of the 1966 World Cup
        final.[61] Manchester United paid tribute to Charlton at their Champions
        League match against Copenhagen at Old Trafford three days later in a
        number of ways. First, United's players wore black armbands, and manager
        Erik ten Hag was flanked by Alex Stepney and U-21 captain Dan Gore
        before ten Hag laid a wreath and a minute's silence was observed before
        the match began. Another wreath was also laid in Charlton's seat in the
        director's box. In addition, the cover of United's match programme, the
        United Review, featured Charlton on the front, and supporters laid
        flowers and scarves at the United Trinity.[62] The funeral took place on
        13 November. The main ceremony was at Manchester Cathedral but the
        procession called first at the Old Trafford stadium before going to the
        city centre. Crowds lined the streets and there were about a thousand
        guests at the service, including Prince William, Alex Ferguson and many
        others associated with the club. Elegies were read by David Gill and
        grandson William Balderston and there was a musical tribute of "How
        Great Thou Art" sung by Russell Watson.[63]
